## About 3agala.com
**3agala.com** is a website targeted to help Egyptians, and hopefully other countries later on, to share ideas, collaborate, and solve real problems. It is intended to replace newspapers in the sense that it will help users post third-party articles that they found interesting.

For now, the project is focused on three categories:
Jokes/Memes, Political discussions with polls graphs and voting systems, and Volunteering

This website comibnes aspects of Reddit, StackOverflow, and adds its own flavors to it.
